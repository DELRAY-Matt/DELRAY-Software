						<h2>First Steps</h2>
						Blade is heavily based on Ultimaker Cura. In particular, you will get quite far by the ordinary
						Cura documentation: <a class="external-link"
							href="https://ultimaker.com/en/resources/51945-first-use-ultimaker-cura"
							rel="nofollow">https://ultimaker.com/en/resources/51945-first-use-ultimaker-cura</a>

						The following sections point out what are the differences and the explicit features of Blade in
						contrast to Cura.

						<strong>Quality Presets:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>"Quality" will result in a slower print, but gives a higher overall print quality.</li>
							<li>"Medium" is faster than "Quality" and was known as "Speed" in previous Simplify3D

						More presets might be added over time.

						<strong>Z Seam Alignment:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Here you can chose where Blade is placing the retraction points.</li>
							<li>With standard settings, Blade will work to place retraction points at less visible
								positions. This is suitable for most geometries. However, in some rare cases you have to
								do manual adjustments.</li>
							<li>If you switch to "User Specified" you can choose a a X-Y coordinates as in Simplify3D.
								If you also check "Z Seam Relative" the position is relative the center of the model.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<strong>Gradual Infill:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>This change the amount of infill gradually.</li>
							<li>This produces a lower infill in the main body and higher infill closer to the surface of
								the part.</li>
							<li>This reduces the printing time and amount of material needed.</li>

						The extruder setup in Blade should be the same as on the machine. If there is more than one
						physical machine, then there shall be for each physical machine a virtual representative in
						Blade.

						For example it is possible to add two ONEs with different extruder setups. These will be saved
						locally on the user's computer and can not be easily transferred to another computer.

						Extruders can be enabled and disabled by right clicking on the extruder in the main menu.

						This is important as there are some setting that change if one or both extruders are enabled .
						If two extruders are enabled, Blade assumes that the user wants to perform dual extrusion.

						So if only T1 (Extruder 2) is used, T0 (Extruder 1) should be disabled and the other way round.

							<h2>All at Once</h2>
							<h3>What it does</h3>
							All models will be printed at the same time. Called Layer-by-Layer in Simplify3D.

							This means that the printer will print one layer of each model and than move to the next
							layer, and so on.
							<h3>Why it should be used</h3>
							All at Once is the default (if both extruders are enabled) and easier to use than "Mixed
							Mode".

							In particular, this configuration is safe and you can print any scenario without taking care
							about safety distances.

							How to use "All at Once"

							If the second extruder is enabled, "All at Once" is the only possible mode. In particular,
							you cannot change it.
							Otherwise, you can change the mode in "Special Modes/Print Sequence".

							Good to know:
							<ul>
								<li>"All at Once" is the default value if both extruders are enabled. Otherwise, "Mixed"
									is the default.</li>
								<li>It is easier to use than Mixed mode.</li>
								<li>A disadvantage is the following: In case of a printer failure, all prints will be
									lost.</li>
								<li>Printing results might be different for each model because the relative motions are
									different.</li>
								<li>Printing time might be higher because of more travel moves.</li>
							</ul>

							<hr />

							<h2>Mixed/Batch Printing</h2>
							<h3>What it does</h3>
							Mixed printing mode replaces the standard Cura "One at a Time". Together with "Mixed" we
							offer the batch printing plugin (Menu→Extensions→Batch Printing) to get the full out if this
							mode.

							To use the full potential of the print bed and still uses the advantage to print model by
							model the mixed mode combines layer by layer printing with model by model.

							But instead of printing each model separate it uses row and columns to make the print safer.

							Depending on the used printer the behavior is slightly different. The ONE and PRO starts at
							the front of the printer, while the STUDIO and STUDIO G2 start from the right.
							<h3>Why it should be used</h3>
							Mixed mode is more complex to use than "All at Once".

							The benefit is that the models will be printed as they would be printed alone. Whenever a
							model is finished it can't be effected by a printer failure.
							<h3>How to use Mixed mode</h3>
							"Mixed" will be automatically enabled when you disable the second extruder.
							You can alter the mode via "Print Sequence/Special Modes".

							As already mentioned, the Mixed mode will do most of the work and chose the right mode
							depending on how the models are placed on the print bed. Placing can then be done via the
							batch printing extension automatically.
							<h4>Print different models in one print:</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Import all models</li>
								<li>If needed, alter settings for specific models by "Per Model Settings"</li>
								<li>If several models form a single part, group them together</li>
								<li>Call "Menu→Extensions→Arrange objects for mixed mode"</li>
							</ul>
							<p style="text-align: center"><img class="size-medium wp-image-16041 aligncenter"
									src="images/image2019-11-14_14-4-52-300x242.png" alt="" width="300" height="242" />
							</p>
							<h4>Print a single model multiple times in one print:</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Import the model (you can also import several models and group them together)</li>
								<li>Call "Menu→Extensions→Populate build plate completely" for having the maximum number
									of copies.
									(Alternatively, you can call "Menu→Extensions→Populate build plate for sequential
									printing" for just populating the rows.
									Or with right click on the model and "Multiply Selected Model" you can create a
									specific number of models and then call "Menu→Extensions→Arrange objects for mixed
									mode")</li>
							</ul>

									width="300" height="249" /></p>

							<p>
								Good to know:
								<ul>
									<li>Always check if the order is correct in the preview.</li>
									<li>You can also use "Per Model Settings" for each model.</li>
									<li>You can group or merge several models to one "part".</li>

							<h2>Custom Profiles</h2>

							A custom profile saves changes to the current default settings.

							A star next to the name of the profile indicates changed settings. You can save these
							changes into your own profile. Also the current layer height, from the current profile will
							be saved in this new profile, but can also be changed afterwards.
							<p style="text-align: center">

								<img class="img-fluid center" src="images/image2020-1-14_11-18-34.png" alt="" />
							</p>
							After the profile is saved, you can find it under the default profiles. You can also update
							your custom profile with additional changed settings.
							<p style="text-align: center">
								<img class="img-fluid center" src="images/image2020-1-14_11-23-45.png" alt="" /> </p>
							If you go "Manage Profiles" you can also see the changes you made. There are global and
							specific extruder settings.
							<br>
							These profiles are only available in your added machine and thus for all extruders and
							materials.
							<br>
							Profiles can also be exported and imported.
							<hr />


							<h2>Custom Materials</h2>

							If you want to add your own none BigRep material, you can do so by going to the manage
							material page (Material → Manage Materials...)
							<br>
							This window shows the generic materials on which the BigRep materials are based on. You can
							duplicate one of these files or create a new one. It is recommended to duplicate the
							material if you have one which is basically the same as one of our materials (a different
							kind of PLA for example). Please be aware that when you copy a material you also copy all
							settings. Some materials are not compatible to all extruders, this can not be changed!
							<p style="text-align: center">
								<img class="img-fluid center" src="images/image2020-1-14_13-15-1.png" alt="" /> </p>
							<br>
							When you have created your own material you can change some settings, like the displayed
							name or brand, but also color, density (which is used for calculating the used material) and
							filament diameter (which is mostly 2.85 mm and used for calculating the right amount of
							extruded material).
							<p style="text-align: center">
								<img class="img-fluid center" src="images/image2020-1-14_13-16-19.png" alt="" /> </p>
							<br>
							The current displayed print settings are the ones for the currently selected extruder and
							can be changed for each extruder separately (you have to close the window, change the
							extruder and than going back again, same for printers). Only a few material related settings
							can be changed here. If you want to change more settings you have to create a custom profile
							(see above).
							<p style="text-align: center">
								<img class="img-fluid center" src="images/image2020-1-14_13-16-45.png" alt="" /> </p>
							Please take a look on other materials for recommendations about settings.
							<br>
							One important setting, different from the Ultimaker Cura setup, is the "Max
							Extruder/Material Feedrate". This setting is used for calculating the maximum possible
							printing speed for a certain layer height in combination with the line width. This value
							states at which speed the extruder can move filament (not the Y/X movment) before it starts
							to underextrude. You can get this value for your material by extruding the material at
							different speeds and see when you reach about 95% of the actual length you wanted to
							extrude. (Be aware that F values in gcodes are in mm/min, while this value is in mm/s).
							Depending on the material, the real value for printing might be lower than the value you got
							from the flow tests.
